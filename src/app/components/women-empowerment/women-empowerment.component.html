        >Empowerment includes raising women’s status through education, career,
        literacy, training, and other aspects of life. Female empowerment is
        defined as promoting a woman’s self-worth and their ability to do things
        based on their own choices and their right to influence social change
        for themselves and others.</span

        >“A girl should be two things: who and what she wants” is a quote by
        Coco Chanel. This shows how female empowerment is a must, and women
        should feel empowered more and more to do what they wish to accomplish
        in their life related to career, education, and any other things. Female
        empowerment is important because it is essential that women are able to
        do everything they set their motivations on. There are times when your
        family doesn’t support you in your decisions, and that is when you need
        to stand for yourself. And empowering yourself is very important and
        much needed, which will determine you as a woman. Women are often seen
        as housewives and caretakers, but these days women are working and doing
        well in their career, and that is what empowerment is, to do better and
        better. Female empowerment is essential because empowering a woman is
        giving the women their rights. They should have equal rights in
        everything that they do. Female empowerment is not only crucial at their
        home but also wherever they go.</span
